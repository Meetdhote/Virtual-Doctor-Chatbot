    ```

3. **Set up your environment variables**:

    Create a `.env` file in the root of the project directory and add the following environment variables (replace the placeholders with your actual Azure OpenAI credentials).

    AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY=<your Azure OpenAI API key>
    OPENAI_API_BASE=<your Azure OpenAI endpoint>
    AZURE_OPENAI_API_VERSION=v1

4. **Run the app**:

    To run the Streamlit app locally, execute:
    streamlit run app.py

    This will start the chatbot at `http://localhost:8501` in your browser.

## .env File Example

The `.env` file should contain the following:
AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY=your_azure_openai_api_key_here
OPENAI_API_BASE=https://<your_azure_openai_endpoint>.openai.azure.com/
AZURE_OPENAI_API_VERSION=v1
